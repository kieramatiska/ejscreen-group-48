## Read in and tidy the data

```{r}
ces <- read_csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```


## Create Hex plot

Create a hex plot with variables proportion white (`white_percent`) on the x-axis and CalEnviroScreen 3.0 score (`ces_3_0_score`) on the y-axis

```{r}
# Hex plot
ggplot(data = ces, 
       aes(x = white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score)) +
  geom_hex() + # Define hex
  labs(title = "Environmental Health Scores for Different Areas \nby Percentage of White People", # Add title
       x = "Proportion of White People (%)", # Add x-axis label
       y = "Environmental Health Score") + # Add y-axis label
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", # Change fill color
                      high = "red",
                      name = "Frequency") + #Change legend title
  theme_minimal() + # Change theme
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # Center title
```
**Figure 1.** Environmental Health Scores for Different Areas by Percentage of White People. The score is determined by the CalEnviroScreen 3.0 tool created by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) at the Environmental Protection Agency in California (CalEPA). The scores are calculated by multiplying pollution burden by population characteristics. Higher scores have both high pollution burdens and more vulnerable populations than those areas with lower scores. Data source: OEHHA, CalEnviroScreen 3.0 (2017).


Based on the overall trend in the plot, it appears that higher proportion of white people are associated with lower Environmental Health Scores, suggesting lower pollution burdens and fewer vulnerable populations. Bins with higher frequency or counts (red) are centered within the cluster of hex bins in the plot. Hex bins provide similar information as a heat map, such as where most of our data is located and how this pattern varies over space.
